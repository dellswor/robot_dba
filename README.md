# Robot DBA
There's not enough time in the day to teach a class and do database administration. The block plan also makes it hard to outsource DB administration to another organization (e.g. ITS). To help address this gap, Robot DBA is an application that reduces some basic DBA tasks to selecting options from a menu.

## Dependencies
3rd party JDBC drivers are needed to interface with various DB backends... Look in lib/INSTALL_ME.md for URLs to get the driver JARs.
